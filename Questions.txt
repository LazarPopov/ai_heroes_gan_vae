- Introduction
    - What is the problem that needs a solution?
        Generating the most human like face.
    - Why is it a problem?
        It is useful in animations and movies creation as it allows a director to choose a face between wider range, a face the it would fit the picture
        that the director had in mind for the script.

        It is useful in advertising, quickly matching a face with a product.
- Main Story
    - Setup
        - With what am I starting with?
            I am starting with reading 2 papers on face generations. GAN and VAE
        - What is the initial plan?
            The intial plan is to comapre GAN and VAE and pick which one is better
    - adventure starts
        - show initial (failing) examples
        - struggle should be clear
              Showing the most fucked up faces with bad training data, not enough examples
    - biggest antagonist
        - After small successes what is the biggest struggle?
              We have good and enough training data but there is still a problem
              We have GAN faces that look like orks, very ugly but HD
              We have VAE faces that look like ghosts, look human but very aerie  and vague
        - How was it overcome?
              Here comes VAE- GAN mixture between GAN and VAE
              Show how the architecture of the 2 is mixed up
        - show final result (better than before)
              Showing final PERFECT VAE-GAN result. The saviour. Sadly not run my us.
- Conclusion
    - Small summary
        - What was learned from the unexpected?
        Due to the nature of the GAN and VAE, whatever that might be, the generated images come with specific relics,
    - What value was generated?
        The value is educational to show how realistic faces can be generated, to avoid the risk for falling for fake videos.........

        Avoiding fraud

        Entertainment

        Or creating personal face of a company,

        Saving resources on actors, animators
